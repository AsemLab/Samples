# Android Samples Code

üìù This repo is a collection of code samples covering various aspects of Android development. It's organized into modules, each focusing on a specific topic. 

Within each module, you will find detailed TODO comments that guide you through implementing each topic step by step.

Currently it contains codebases for:

- [App Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/shortcuts): Shortcuts can be diplayed in a supported launcher. They help users quickly start common or recommended tasks within apps.
- [Chuncker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker): an HTTP inspector for Android & OkHTTP. Apps using Chucker will display a notification showing a summary of ongoing HTTP activity.

- [lint](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/7.2/com/android/build/api/dsl/Lint?hl=en): is static code analysis tools used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs:
  - [Ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/latest/): an anti-bikeshedding Kotlin linter with built-in formatter.
  - [Detekt](https://detekt.dev/): a static code analysis tool for the Kotlin.
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation): the Navigation component handles diverse navigation use cases, from straightforward button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/kotlin/): fast, powerful data storage for Kotlin and KMM apps.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber/): a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
