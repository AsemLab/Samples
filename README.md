# Android Samples Code

üìù This repo is a collection of code samples covering various aspects of Android development. It's organized into modules, each focusing on a specific topic. 

Within each module, you will find detailed TODO comments that guide you through implementing each topic step by step.

Currently it contains codebases for:

- [App](https://github.com/AsemLab/Samples/tree/main/app): a general module contains and covers the various topics.
- [Activity Recognition](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/transitions): Detects changes in the user's activity( such as walking, running, or driving). By subscribes to a transition in activities of interest and the API notifies the app only when needed.
- [App Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/shortcuts): Shortcuts can be displayed in a supported launcher. They help users quickly start common or recommended tasks within apps.

- [Broadcast Receiver](https://github.com/AsemLab/Samples/tree/main/broadcast_receiver): Create a custom broadcast receiver.
- [Build Variants](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants): a way to create different versions of your app from a single project. Each build variant represents a different version of your app that you can build.

- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation): The Navigation component handles diverse navigation use cases, from straightforward button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.  See [main_graph.xml](https://github.com/AsemLab/Samples/blob/main/navigation-component/src/main/res/navigation/main_graph.xml) to learn how to navigate between modules.
- [Play Feature Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/feature-delivery): Uses advanced capabilities of app bundles, allowing certain features of your app to be delivered conditionally or downloaded on demand. See [feature_delivery](https://github.com/AsemLab/Samples/tree/main/feature_delivery) module.
- [Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/kotlin/): fast, powerful data storage for Kotlin and KMM apps.
